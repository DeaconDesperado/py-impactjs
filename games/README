Add your games to this directory. These will NOT be tracked by version control.
Make your game directory look like Impact's, but without the Impact code.

For example:
games/
    mygame/
        media/
            player.png
            tiles.png
        lib/
            game/
                entities/
                    player.js
                levels/
                    mylevel.js
                main.js
